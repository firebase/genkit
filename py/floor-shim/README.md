# genkit Python-floor shim

A one-time PyPI release (`genkit 0.3.0`, sdist only) that turns the
old-Python install experience from a silent wrong install into a clear
upgrade message.

## Why it exists

Genkit requires Python >= 3.10, but macOS ships Python 3.9 at
`/usr/bin/python3`. On that interpreter, `pip install genkit` used to
resolve `genkit 0.2.0` — an unrelated package from before the PyPI name
was transferred to this project ("random data like phone numbers") —
because those pre-transfer releases (0.1.0–0.2.0) declare
`Requires-Python: >=3.6` and pip silently falls back to them.

## How it works

- The shim declares `Requires-Python: <3.10`, so Python >= 3.10 can
  never select it. Fresh installs on current Pythons keep getting the
  real latest genkit.
- On Python <= 3.9, version 0.3.0 outranks the pre-transfer 0.2.0, pip
  commits to it, and `setup.py` fails the **install phase** with a boxed
  message: the 3.10 requirement plus uv / Homebrew / python.org
  instructions. The failure must stay out of the metadata phase
  (`egg_info`/`dist_info`/`sdist` succeed on purpose): old pip treats a
  metadata failure as a discardable candidate and backtracks to the
  pre-transfer 0.2.0 with exit 0 — the silent wrong install again.
- It is published as an **sdist only**. A wheel would install cleanly as
  an empty package on old Pythons — exactly the silent failure this
  prevents. Keep the `--sdist` flag in `publish_python.yml`.
- The boxed message is for `pip install genkit` and
  `uv pip install genkit`. A second name on the same line
  (`pip install genkit genkit-google-genai`) fails in the resolver on
  that plugin's `Requires-Python: >=3.10` and never reaches this
  `setup.py`.

The version never changes: 0.3.0 was never published (the history goes
0.3.0.dev2 -> 0.3.1), and it sits above 0.2.0 (the last pre-transfer
release) and below 0.3.1 (the first real genkit release).
`skip-existing: true` in the publish workflow makes re-publishing it on
every release tag a no-op after the first upload.

This directory is intentionally not a uv workspace member: it shares the
`genkit` project name with `packages/genkit`, and workspace project
names must be unique.

## Verifying

```bash
# Build (any Python >= 3.10):
uv build --sdist py/floor-shim --out-dir /tmp/shim-dist

# Old Python shows the boxed message (expected: install fails with instructions):
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv /tmp/v39 && /tmp/v39/bin/pip install --no-index \
  --find-links /tmp/shim-dist genkit

# The load-bearing case — a competing old release is visible (stands in for
# the pre-transfer 0.2.0). Expected: exit != 0, boxed message, and NOTHING
# installed. If genkit 0.2.0 gets installed instead, the shim is failing at
# the metadata phase and old pip is backtracking past it:
mkdir -p /tmp/sq && printf 'from setuptools import setup\nsetup(name="genkit", version="0.2.0", python_requires=">=3.6")\n' > /tmp/sq/setup.py
uv build --wheel /tmp/sq --out-dir /tmp/shim-dist
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv /tmp/v39b && /tmp/v39b/bin/pip install --no-index \
  --find-links /tmp/shim-dist genkit; /tmp/v39b/bin/pip show genkit

# Current Python ignores the shim even when visible (expected: installs real genkit):
python3.13 -m venv /tmp/v313 && /tmp/v313/bin/pip install \
  --find-links /tmp/shim-dist genkit
```

## Required companion step: yank the pre-transfer releases

Yank 0.1.0, 0.1.3, 0.1.4, and 0.2.0 on pypi.org **before or together
with** the first shim publish. This is a precondition, not optional
cleanup: those releases are the fallback candidates old pip reaches for
whenever it decides to skip the shim, and yanking is what makes the
wrong package unreachable for every resolver generation. After the
yank, pinned installs (`genkit==0.2.0`) are the only way to reach them.
