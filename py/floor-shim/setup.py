"""Python-floor shim for the `genkit` package on PyPI.

Real genkit releases require Python >= 3.10. On older interpreters
(like the Python 3.9 that macOS ships), pip either resolves nothing or
resolves an unrelated pre-transfer package that holds low version
numbers on PyPI. This sdist declares `Requires-Python: <3.10`, so
current interpreters can never select it, while old interpreters pick
it as their best candidate and get a clear how-to-upgrade message
instead of a resolver error.

Publish as sdist ONLY (`uv build --sdist`). A wheel would install
"successfully" as an empty package on old Pythons, which is the silent
failure this shim exists to prevent. Version 0.3.0 was never published
(the history goes 0.3.0.dev2 -> 0.3.1), so the shim fills that hole:
above the pre-transfer squatter releases (<= 0.2.0), below every real
genkit release (>= 0.3.1). It never needs to change.

# a discardable candidate and backtracks to the pre-transfer 0.2.0 — the
# exact silent wrong-install this shim exists to prevent. An install-phase
# failure is fatal on every pip generation, so the user actually sees the
# message and nothing gets installed.
