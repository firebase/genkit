    """An asynchronous channel for sending and receiving values.

    This class provides an asynchronous queue-like interface, allowing values to
    be sent and received between different parts of an asynchronous program. It
    supports both sending values and closing the channel, which will signal to
    any receivers that no more values will be sent.

    The Channel class implements the async iterator protocol, allowing it to be
    used in async for loops.

    Typical usage:
        ```python
        channel: Channel[int, int] = Channel(timeout=0.1)

        # Send values to the channel
        channel.send(1)
        channel.send(2)

        # Receive values from the channel in another task
        async for value in channel:
            print(value)  # Will print 1, then 2
        ```
