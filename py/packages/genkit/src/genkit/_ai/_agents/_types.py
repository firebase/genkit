# set — they shape only what a client sees, never persisted state. Both fail closed:
# a hook that raises propagates rather than leaking the unredacted value, so keeping
# the two consistent (e.g. redacting the same fields) is the caller's job.
#
# StateTransform — redact or reshape session state before it leaves the server.
# It shapes snapshot reads, client-managed AgentOutput, and the baseline for streamed
# custom patches. It must return a state: to hide the whole thing, return an
# explicitly cleared one — there's no "return None to omit," precisely so a transform
# that forgets to return can't silently wipe the client's entire view.

# Returning None drops the chunk (the point of the hook, e.g. hide artifact chunks);
# the blast radius is one chunk, so unlike the state hook that's safe.
