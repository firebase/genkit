"""Leaf module of structural interfaces (Protocols) for core Genkit types.

Keeping interfaces here instead of in their implementation modules breaks
circular-import cycles.  A realistic example in Genkit is the Registry/Plugin/Middleware cycle:

    1. Registry (_registry.py) imports Plugin (_plugin.py) to manage plugins.
    2. Plugin (_plugin.py) imports GenerateMiddleware (_middleware.py) to type-hint list_middleware.
    3. BaseMiddleware/GenerateMiddleware (_middleware.py) need to annotate their request-scoped
       registry attribute, which refers back to Registry.

    If _middleware.py imported Registry from _registry.py directly, it would complete the
    import cycle: _registry -> _plugin -> _middleware -> _registry.

    Solution: BaseMiddleware type-hints with RegistryLike from this leaf module, breaking the cycle.
