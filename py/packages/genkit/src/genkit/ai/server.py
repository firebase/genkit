"""Functionality used by the Genkit veneer to start multiple servers.

The following servers may be started depending upon the host environment:

- Reflection API server.
- Flows server.

The reflection API server is started only in dev mode, which is enabled by the
setting the environment variable `GENKIT_ENV` to `dev`. By default, the
reflection API server binds and listens on (localhost, 3100 or the next available
port).  The flows server is the production servers that exposes flows and actions
over HTTP.
