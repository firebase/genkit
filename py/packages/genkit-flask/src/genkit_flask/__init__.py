"""Flask Plugin for Genkit.

This plugin provides Flask integration for Genkit, enabling you to expose
Genkit flows as HTTP endpoints in a Flask application.

Example:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask
    from genkit import Genkit
    from genkit_flask import genkit_flask_handler
    from genkit_google_genai import GoogleAI

    # 1. Initialize Flask app and Genkit with GoogleAI
    app = Flask(__name__)
    ai = Genkit(plugins=[GoogleAI()], model=GoogleAI.gemini_model('gemini-flash-latest'))


    # 2. Stack Flask route + Genkit handler + flow on one function
    @app.post('/api/greet')
    @genkit_flask_handler(ai)
    @ai.flow()
    async def greet_user(name: str) -> str:
        res = await ai.generate(prompt=f'Say hello to {name} in one sentence.')
        return res.text


    # POST /api/greet {"data": "Alice"}
    # => {"result": "Hello Alice! Welcome to our AI community."}
    ```

Requirements:
    - Requires Flask 3.1+.
    - Async flows are run via an asyncio event loop within the Flask request handler.
