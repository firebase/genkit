"""Package manager protocol for releasekit.

The :class:`PackageManager` protocol defines the async interface for
building, publishing, and testing packages. Implementations:

- :class:`~releasekit.backends.pm.uv.UvBackend` — ``uv`` CLI
- :class:`~releasekit.backends.pm.pnpm.PnpmBackend` — ``pnpm`` CLI

Design notes:

- ``resolve_check()`` uses ``uv pip install --dry-run`` (D-9) for
  consistency with the uv toolchain.
