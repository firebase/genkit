"""Version manifest for CI handoff and audit trail.

A :class:`ReleaseManifest` captures the complete versioning state of a
release run: which packages were bumped, what their old/new versions are,
which bump type was applied, and the git SHA at the time of computation.

Key Concepts (ELI5)::

    ┌─────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Concept             │ ELI5 Explanation                               │
    ├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ PackageVersion      │ One package's version record: old version,    │
    │                     │ new version, bump type, and reason.           │
    ├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ ReleaseManifest     │ A snapshot of all packages in a release run.  │
    │                     │ Can be saved as JSON for CI handoff or audit. │

Usage::

    from releasekit.versions import PackageVersion, ReleaseManifest

    manifest = ReleaseManifest(
        git_sha='abc123',
        packages=[
            PackageVersion(
                name='genkit',
                old_version='0.4.0',
                new_version='0.5.0',
                bump='minor',
                reason='feat: add streaming support',
            ),
        ],
    )

    # Export for CI
    manifest.save(Path('release-manifest.json'))

    # Import in a later CI step
    loaded = ReleaseManifest.load(Path('release-manifest.json'))
