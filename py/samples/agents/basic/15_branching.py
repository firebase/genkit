"""Branch a conversation: fork one turn into sibling timelines.

Every store-backed turn is a snapshot you can fork from. Run a shared setup turn,
then start two branches from that turn's snapshot with different follow-ups. You
get sibling timelines instead of one linear history — the move when someone wants
to compare directions, or hit "try again" on a turn, without losing the setup or
overwriting the first answer.

Once the tree forks, "the latest turn for this session" is ambiguous, so a
session-id lookup surfaces a structured, recoverable error instead of guessing.
You resolve it by continuing from the specific leaf you mean — and from there
it's a normal linear chat again. Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
