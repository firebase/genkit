"""Shape what the client sees with state_transform / chunk_transform.

Two hooks run at the egress boundary; the stored/server-side state is never
touched, only the client's view:

  - state_transform: reshape or redact session state before it leaves. It shapes
    snapshot reads, client-managed output, and the baseline for streamed custom
    patches.
  - chunk_transform: reshape or drop each stream chunk in flight. Return None to
    drop it.

Here the agent keeps an api_key in its custom state and emits an internal
artifact, but the client sees neither: state strips the key, chunk drops the
artifact. Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
