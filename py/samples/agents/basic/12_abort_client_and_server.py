"""Two ways to stop an agent: turn.abort() (client) vs chat.abort() (server).

turn.abort() is a client-side detach — you stop reading the stream and the turn
settles immediately, while the server turn keeps running to completion. The prompt
you sent stays in history (it was still asked), so the session just continues from
there; it works with or without a store. chat.abort() is the opposite:
it halts the work on the server, firing the abort_signal inside running tools so a
detached turn settles ABORTED. It needs a store. Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
