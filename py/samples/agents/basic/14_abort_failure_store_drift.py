"""Three ways a turn can end early, and what each does to history and the store.

A turn that doesn't land a normal reply can get there three different ways, and
they are genuinely different — especially once you reload the session from the
store, which is the source of truth:

  1. turn.abort() — a *client-side* detach. You stop listening, but the server
     turn keeps running and completes. The store shows a finished turn with no
     trace of the abort, while your in-memory chat is left holding an unanswered
     prompt. The client view drifts ahead of (really, behind) the store.

  2. task.abort() — a *server-side* cancel of a detached turn. The snapshot
     settles ABORTED and never becomes the session's resume point. abort()
     returns the snapshot's status from *before* this call (``pending`` when
     it cancelled in-flight work). The in-memory chat keeps the prompt (it
     was still asked) and still points at that aborted leaf, so send() is
     rejected. chat(session_id=) continues from the last completed turn.
     load_chat(session_id=) would show the aborted row.

  3. a real server error (e.g. the model is exhausted) — the chat client raises
     AgentError, the optimistic prompt is rolled back, and the resume handle stays
     pinned to the last good turn, so the next send picks up from there.

And a fourth, related point: a detached turn that *succeeds* still never streams
its reply back to your in-memory chat, so before continuing you reload from the
store to resync — otherwise the next turn builds on a view that's missing the
reply.

Uses a no-model custom agent and a linear (parent-retaining) store, so it runs
deterministically with no API key.
