"""Git for agent state: rewinding restores the artifact, not just the messages.

A builder agent keeps a landing page in a `landing.md` artifact. The main line
drifts into a stiff enterprise direction we don't love, so we rewind to the
checkpoint right after the headline. Loading that snapshot restores the WHOLE
state — the artifact reverts with the conversation — so the playful timeline we
build next grows from the original headline, and the enterprise page is untouched.

Every turn is a snapshot you can rewind to. Swap InMemorySessionStore
for FileSessionStore to keep the tree on disk. Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
