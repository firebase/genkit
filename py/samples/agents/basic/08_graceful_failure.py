"""A failing turn fails gracefully instead of crashing the chat.

One turn succeeds; the next raises inside the agent. The chat client surfaces
that as AgentError so your app can catch it, but the session stays usable:
the failed turn doesn't advance the resume handle — it stays pinned to the last
successful snapshot — so the next send picks up from that last good parent. The
failure is a dead end, not a new branch point.
