"""Put a deadline on a turn with plain asyncio.

A turn's `.response` is a normal awaitable, so the native Python tools work on
it: wrap `await turn.response` (or the `.stream`) in `asyncio.wait_for(...)`, or
cancel the surrounding task, and the turn detaches just like turn.abort() — the client
stops listening, the server finishes in the background, and the prompt you sent
stays in history. The deadline then surfaces as TimeoutError. Requires
GEMINI_API_KEY.

async def main() -> None:
    chat = agent.chat()

    # Give the turn 1.5s to finish; if it overruns, the deadline cancels the await,
    # the turn detaches, and we get a TimeoutError — no genkit-specific cancel API.

    # Detach is client-side only: the prompt stays in history (it was still asked),
    # and turn 1's context is intact, so the next turn continues cleanly.
