"""Kick off a long task, get a handle back immediately, poll for the result.

For work that outlives a request — a big research report here — the client sends
``detach`` and the server keeps running after returning a snapshot id. The client
polls that id until it settles (or aborts it). A store is required: it's where the
server parks the result for the client to pick up later.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
