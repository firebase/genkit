"""The hello-world agent: a tool, a store, and streaming multi-turn chat.

``weatherAgent`` keeps its history in a file-backed store, so the server owns the
conversation and a caller only ever needs a session id to pick it back up. The
``test_weather_agent`` flow is what you click Run on in the Dev UI — it drives the
agent exactly the way real code does, through ``agent.chat()``.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
