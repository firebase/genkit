"""The one Genkit instance every agent in this folder shares.

Each agent file registers itself on this ``ai`` the moment it's imported, so the
Dev UI (running a single file) and the FastAPI server (importing all of them)
both see the same registry. Same idea as the JS testapp's ``genkit.ts``.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
