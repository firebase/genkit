"""Fork a conversation into parallel what-ifs from a shared snapshot.

Every settled turn leaves a snapshot id. Point a new chat at an earlier snapshot
and you get an independent branch that shares history up to that point but
diverges after — so you can explore "what if I'd said X instead" without
disturbing the original. This is the primitive behind regenerate, variants, and
time-travel.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
