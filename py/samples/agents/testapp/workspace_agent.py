"""An agent that builds up a workspace of files as it goes.

A ``write_artifact`` tool drops named files onto the session. Artifacts stream to
the client as ``artifact`` chunks as they're written and dedupe by name (rewriting
a file replaces it), so the client can render a live file tree. This is the
backbone of any "generate me a project" agent.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
