"""File-backed persistence: the server owns the conversation, on disk.

``fileStoreAgent`` is a logbook assistant whose history lives in a
``FileSessionStore``. A single ``chat`` persists after every turn and picks the
thread back up automatically, so a caller only ever needs the session's snapshot
id to resume — nothing about the conversation is round-tripped over the wire.

The second flow uses a store capped at three turns
(``max_persisted_chain_length=3``): each turn lands as its own
``<snapshot_id>.json`` file, and once the chain grows past the cap the oldest
snapshot is deleted so a long-lived session's history stays bounded on disk.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
