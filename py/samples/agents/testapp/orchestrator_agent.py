"""One agent that delegates to specialist sub-agents.

The trick is that an agent is just something you can ``chat()`` with — so a
delegation tool can spin up a sub-agent, run a turn, and hand its answer back as
the tool result. The orchestrator picks which specialist to call; the specialists
(researcher, coder) stay focused. This is multi-agent composition with nothing
but tools and chats.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY.
