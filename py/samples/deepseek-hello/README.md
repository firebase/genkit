## DeepSeek Sample

### How to Get Your DeepSeek API Key

A DeepSeek API key is a secret token for accessing DeepSeek's powerful AI models, obtained by signing up/logging in at platform.deepseek.com, navigating to the API Keys section in your dashboard, and clicking "Create API Key," requiring an account and potentially adding funds for usage beyond free limits.

**Steps:**
1. **Sign Up/Login**: Go to [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/) and log in (often with a Google account).
2. **Navigate to API Keys**: Find the "API Keys" section in your dashboard (usually on the left sidebar).
3. **Create Key**: Click the "Create API Key" button and give it a name (e.g., "my-app").
4. **Copy Key**: Copy the generated key immediately as it's shown only once.
5. **Add Credits (if needed)**: You might need to add funds or a payment method for usage beyond the free tier.

#### Monitoring and Running

For an enhanced development experience, use the provided `run.sh` script to start the sample with automatic reloading:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This script uses `watchmedo` to monitor changes in:
- `src/` (Python logic)
- `../../packages` (Genkit core)
- `../../plugins` (Genkit plugins)
- File patterns: `*.py`, `*.prompt`, `*.json`

Changes will automatically trigger a restart of the sample. You can also pass command-line arguments directly to the script, e.g., `./run.sh --some-flag`.

### Usage

1. Setup environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv sync
```

2. Set DeepSeek API key (get one from [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/)):
```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

3. Run the sample:
```bash
genkit start -- uv run src/main.py
```

## Testing This Demo

1. **Open DevUI** at http://localhost:4000

2. **Test basic flows**:
   - [ ] `say_hi` - Simple generation with deepseek-chat
   - [ ] `streaming_flow` - Streaming response
   - [ ] `custom_config_flow` - Custom temperature/config

3. **Test tools**:
   - [ ] `weather_flow` - Tool calling

4. **Test reasoning** (deepseek-reasoner):
   - [ ] `reasoning_flow` - Chain-of-thought reasoning
   - [ ] Note: Reasoning shows detailed thought process

5. **Test chat**:
   - [ ] `chat_flow` - Multi-turn conversation

6. **Expected behavior**:
   - deepseek-chat: Fast, capable responses
   - deepseek-reasoner: Detailed reasoning chains
   - Tools work with compatible models
