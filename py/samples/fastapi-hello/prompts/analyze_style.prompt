Analyze this {{language}} code for STYLE and best practice issues ONLY.

```{{language}}
{{code}}
```

Look for:
- Missing type hints
- Poor naming conventions
- Code duplication
- Complex functions that should be split
- Missing documentation
- Inconsistent formatting

IMPORTANT:
- Only report STYLE issues. Do not report security or bug issues.
- Include the exact line number where the issue occurs.
- All issues must have category: "style"
- If code follows best practices, return an empty issues list.
