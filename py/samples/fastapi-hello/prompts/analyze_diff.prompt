Review this code diff for any issues (security, bugs, or style).

```diff
{{diff}}
```

{{#if context}}
Additional context: {{context}}
{{/if}}

Focus on the CHANGED lines (+ lines in the diff). Report any:
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- Bugs or logic errors
- Style violations

IMPORTANT:
- Line numbers should reference the NEW file (after the change)
- Only report issues in the changed code, not pre-existing issues
- If the changes look good, return an empty issues list.
