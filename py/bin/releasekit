# Wrapper script for the ``releasekit`` tool.
#
# This is the only file that knows about the repository layout.
# The releasekit tool itself is fully portable — all repo-specific
# settings are supplied via the releasekit.toml config file discovered
# automatically from the workspace root.
#
# Usage:
#   py/bin/releasekit discover          List all workspace packages
#   py/bin/releasekit check             Run workspace health checks
#   py/bin/releasekit check --fix       Auto-fix what can be fixed
#   py/bin/releasekit plan              Preview the execution plan
#   py/bin/releasekit publish --dry-run Dry-run publish
#   py/bin/releasekit graph             Show the dependency graph
#   py/bin/releasekit version           Show computed version bumps
#   py/bin/releasekit explain <CODE>    Explain an error code
#   py/bin/releasekit --help            Show help
