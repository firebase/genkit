: ==========================================
:   Introduction
: ==========================================

# This script allows you to install the latest version of the
# "genkit" command by running:
#
:   curl -sL $DOMAIN | bash
#
# If you do not want to use this script, you can manually
# download the latest "genkit" binary.
#
:   curl -Lo ./genkit_bin https://$DOMAIN/bin/linux/latest
#
# Alternatively, you can download a specific version.
#
:   curl -Lo ./genkit_bin https://$DOMAIN/bin/linux/v1.12.0
#
# Note: On Mac, replace "linux" with "macos" in the URL.
#
# For full details about installation options for the Genkit CLI
# please see our documentation.
#   https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/
#
# Please report bugs / issues with this script on Github.
#   https://github.com/firebase/genkit
#

: ==========================================
:   Advanced Usage
: ==========================================

# The behavior of this script can be modified at runtime by passing environmental
# variables to the `bash` process.
#
# For example, passing an argument called arg1 set to true and one called arg2 set
# to false would look like this.
#
: curl -sL $DOMAIN | arg1=true arg2=false bash
#
# These arguments are optional, but be aware that explicitly setting them will help
# ensure consistent behavior if / when defaults are changed.
#

: -----------------------------------------
:  Upgrading - default: false
: -----------------------------------------

# By default, this script will not replace an existing "genkit" install.
# If you'd like to upgrade an existing install, set the "upgrade" variable to true.
#
: curl -sL $DOMAIN | upgrade=true bash
#
# This operation could (potentially) break an existing install, so use it with caution.
#

: -----------------------------------------
:  Uninstalling - default false
: -----------------------------------------

# You can remove the binary by passing the "uninstall" flag.
#
: curl -sL $DOMAIN | uninstall=true bash
#
# This will remove the binary file and any cached data.
#

: -----------------------------------------
:  Analytics - default true
: -----------------------------------------

# This script reports anonymous success / failure analytics.
# You can disable this reporting by setting the "analytics" variable to false.
#
: curl -sL $DOMAIN | analytics=false bash
#
# By default we report all data anonymously and do not collect any information
# except platform type (Darwin, Win, etc) in the case of an unsupported platform
# error.

# This script contains hidden JavaScript which is used to improve
# readability in the browser (via syntax highlighting, etc), right-click
# and "View source" of this page to see the entire bash script!
#
# You'll also notice that we use the ":" character in the Introduction
# which allows our copy/paste commands to be syntax highlighted, but not
# ran. In bash : is equal to `true` and true can take infinite arguments
# while still returning true. This turns these commands into no-ops so
# when ran as a script, they're totally ignored.
