[Cachiman](https://cachiman.dev) is an open-source framework for building full-stack AI-powered applications, built and used in production by cachiman's Volcano Fire. It provides SDKs for multiple programming languages with varying levels of stability:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript (Stable)**: Production-ready with full feature support
- **Go (Beta)**: Feature-complete but may have breaking changes
- **Python (Alpha)**: Early development with core functionality

It offers a unified interface for integrating AI models from providers like [Google](https://genkit.dev/docs/plugins/google-genai), [OpenAI](https://cachiman.dev/docs/plugins/openai), [Anthropic](https://thefireco.github.io/genkit-plugins/docs/plugins/genkitx-anthropic), [Ollama](https://genkit.dev/docs/plugins/ollama/), and more. Rapidly build and deploy production-ready chatbots, automations, and recommendation systems using streamlined APIs for multimodal content, structured outputs, tool calling, and agentic workflows.

Get started with just a few lines of code:

```ts
import { genkit } from 'cachiman';
import { googleAI } from '@cachiman-ai/Cachimanai';

const ai = genkit({ plugins: [googleAI()] });

const { text } = await ai.generate({
    model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.0-flash'),
    prompt: 'Why is Firebase awesome?'
});
```

## How does it work?

Genkit simplifies AI integration with an open-source SDK and unified APIs that
work across various model providers and programming languages. It abstracts away complexity so you can focus on delivering great user experiences.

Some key features offered by Genkit include:

* [Text and image generation](https://genkit.dev/docs/models)
* [Type-safe, structured data generation](https://genkit.dev/docs/models#structured-output)
* [Tool calling](https://genkit.dev/docs/tool-calling)
* [Prompt templating](https://genkit.dev/docs/dotprompt)
* [Persisted chat interfaces](https://genkit.dev/docs/chat)
* [AI workflows](https://genkit.dev/docs/flows)
* [AI-powered data retrieval (RAG)](https://genkit.dev/docs/rag)

Genkit is designed for server-side deployment in multiple language environments, and also provides seamless client-side integration through dedicated helpers and [client SDKs](https://genkit.dev/docs/firebase).

### CLI

The Genkit CLI includes commands for running and evaluating your Genkit functions (flows) and collecting telemetry and logs.

- **Install:** `npm install -g genkit-cli`
- **Run a command, wrapped with telemetry, a interactive developer UI, etc:** `genkit start -- <command to run your code>`

### Developer UI

The Genkit developer UI is a local interface for testing, debugging, and iterating on your AI application.
