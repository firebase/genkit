# Flows

Flows are wrapped functions with some additional characteristics over direct
calls: they are strongly typed, streamable, locally and remotely callable, and
fully observable.
Firebase Genkit provides CLI and developer UI tooling for running and debugging flows.

## Defining flows

In its simplest form, a flow just wraps a function:

- {Go}

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go flow1

Doing so lets you run the function from the Genkit CLI and developer UI, and is
a requirement for many of Genkit's features, including deployment and
observability.

An important advantage Genkit flows have over directly calling a model API is
type safety of both inputs and outputs:

- {Go}

  The argument and result types of a flow can be simple or structured values.
  Genkit will produce JSON schemas for these values using
  [`invopop/jsonschema`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/invopop/jsonschema).

  The following flow takes a `string` as input and outputs a `struct`:

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go msug

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go flow2

## Running flows

To run a flow in your code:

- {Go}

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go run1

You can use the CLI to run flows as well:

```posix-terminal
genkit flow:run menuSuggestionFlow '"French"'
```

### Streamed

Here's a simple example of a flow that can stream values:

- {Go}

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go streaming-types

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go streaming

Note that the streaming callback can be undefined. It's only defined if the
invoking client is requesting streamed response.

To invoke a flow in streaming mode:

- {Go}

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go invoke-streaming

  If the flow doesn't implement streaming, `StreamFlow()` behaves identically to
  `RunFlow()`.

You can use the CLI to stream flows as well:

```posix-terminal
genkit flow:run menuSuggestionFlow '"French"' -s
```

## Deploying flows

If you want to be able to access your flow over HTTP you will need to deploy it
first.

- {Go}

  To deploy flows using Cloud Run and similar services, define your flows, and
  then call `StartFlowServer()`:

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go main

  `StartFlowsServer` starts a `net/http` server that exposes your flows as HTTP
  endpoints (for example, `http://localhost:3400/menuSuggestionFlow`). Both
  parameters are optional:

  - You can specify the address and port to listen on. If you don't,
    the server listens on any address and the port specified by the PORT
    environment variable; if that is empty, it uses the default of port 3400.
  - You can specify which flows to serve. If you don't, `StartFlowsServer`
    serves all of your defined flows.

  If you want to serve flows on the same host and port as other endpoints, you
  can call `NewFlowServeMux()` to get a handler for your Genkit flows, which you
  can multiplex with your other route handlers:

  %include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go mux

## Flow observability

Sometimes when using 3rd party SDKs that are not instrumented for observability,
you might want to see them as a separate trace step in the Developer UI. All you
need to do is wrap the code in the `run` function.

%include ../go/internal/doc-snippets/flows.go run
