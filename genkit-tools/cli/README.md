# Genkit CLI

The package contains the CLI for Genkit, an open source framework with rich local tooling to help app developers build, test, deploy, and monitor AI-powered features for their apps with confidence. Genkit is built by Firebase, Google's app development platform that is trusted by millions of businesses around the world.

Review the [documentation](https://genkit.dev/docs/get-started) for details and samples.

To install the CLI:

```bash
npm i -g genkit
```

Available commands:

- `init [options]`

  initialize a project directory with Genkit

- `start [options]`

  run the app in dev mode and start a Developer UI

- `flow:run [options] <flowName> [data]`

  run a flow using provided data as input

- `flow:batchRun [options] <flowName> <inputFileName>`

  batch run a flow using provided set of data from a file as input

- `flow:resume <flowName> <flowId> <data>`

  resume an interrupted flow (experimental)

- `eval:extractData [options] <flowName>`

  extract evaludation data for a given flow from the trace store

- `eval:run [options] <dataset>`

  evaluate provided dataset against configured evaluators

- `eval:flow [options] <flowName> [data]`

  evaluate a flow against configured evaluators using provided data as input

**Parallelism tip:** for both `eval:run` (when your dataset already includes outputs) and `eval:flow`, setting `--batchSize` greater than 1 runs inference and evaluator actions in parallel (capped at 100). Higher values can speed up runs but may hit model/API rate limits or increase resource usage—tune according to your environment.

- `config`

  set development environment configuration

- `help`
