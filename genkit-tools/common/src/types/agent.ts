 *   terminal status.
 * - `aborting`: the `abort` companion action stopped a detached invocation
 *   and its worker is winding down toward the write that stamps the state
 *   on the row. Not terminal and not yet resumable: the worker keeps
 *   refreshing `heartbeatAt` while it drains, and the row settles as
 *   `aborted`. Written by runtimes whose abort stops the work before the
 *   state is recorded; a runtime that records both in one write goes to
 *   `aborted` directly.
 * - `completed`: the snapshot captures a settled state.
 * - `aborted`: the snapshot's invocation was aborted via the
 *   `abort` companion action while detached.
 * - `failed`: a turn ended with an error. The snapshot's `error` field
 *   describes the failure, and its state is what the turn committed before
 *   it: the conversation trimmed back to the last completed tool round.
 *   Resume is permitted, so whether the failure is worth another attempt is
 *   the client's decision, taken from `error.status`.
 * - `expired`: a `pending` or `aborting` snapshot whose detached background
 *   worker is presumed dead because its heartbeat went stale. Computed on
 *   read from a stale `heartbeatAt`; never persisted (the dead worker can no
 *   longer write a terminal status itself).
