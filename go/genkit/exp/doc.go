Package exp holds experimental Genkit concepts that are still taking shape.
Each constructor takes a *[genkit.Genkit] and registers on its registry, just
like the stable genkit constructors; the experimental surface lives here so it
can churn without touching genkit's stable namespace. It currently provides:

  - Agent constructors: [DefineAgent] (inline prompt), [DefinePromptAgent] (a
    prompt sourced from the registry), and [DefineCustomAgent] (full control
    over the per-turn loop), plus [ListAgents] for introspection. An agent is a
    stateful, multi-turn conversational action built on bidirectional streaming;
    serve one with [genkit.Handler] or the route builders below.

  - An HTTP route layout for serving agents and flows: the [Route] value and
    the [AgentRoutes] / [AllAgentRoutes] / [FlowRoutes] / [AllFlowRoutes]
    builders. Range over the routes and wire each onto an [http.ServeMux] (or
    any router) with [Route.Pattern] and [Route.Handler]. The handlers
    themselves come from the stable genkit package ([genkit.Handler]); this
    package only lays out which paths map to which actions, so the routing
    layer can evolve without touching genkit's stable surface.

  - A channel-based streaming flow constructor, [DefineStreamingFlow]: an
    alternative to the callback-based [genkit.DefineStreamingFlow] for logic
    that is more naturally expressed by writing chunks to a channel.

Every constructor here requires opting in: initialize Genkit with
[genkit.WithExperimental], or the constructors panic with a message explaining
how to enable them. The opt-in is the acknowledgement that these features are in
preview and/or under active development, with APIs that may have breaking or
backward-incompatible changes in any minor version release.
