// barista.go is the session-state demo.
//
// The other agents carry only their conversation from turn to turn. The
// barista also carries a running order, and its system instruction is rebuilt
// from that order every turn, so what the agent is told grows as the
// conversation does. The two halves are:
//
//   - the tool (addToOrder) writes session state through the live session it
//     finds on its context;
//   - the prompt (ai.WithSystemFn) reads that state back and turns it into
//     instructions.
//
// The state is a Go struct, not a bag of keys: the agent is an
// Agent[BaristaOrder], so its store, its snapshots, and every read of
// aix.SessionFromContext are typed end to end. The other agents in this sample
// keep no state of their own and are Agent[any].
//
// This is what a prompt-backed agent can do that a fixed system string cannot,
// and it is the reason the agent's replies stay consistent over a long order
// without the model having to re-read the whole transcript.
