// This sample demonstrates the agent APIs by defining seven agents in different
// styles, one per file, behind a single CLI:
//
//   - pirate (pirate.go): DefineAgent with the prompt declared inline.
//   - chef (chef.go): DefinePromptAgent, which defaults to the prompt
//     registered under the agent's name, ./prompts/chef.prompt.
//   - coder (coder.go): DefineCustomAgent, with the per-turn loop wired by
//     hand.
//   - banker (banker.go): a prompt agent with an interruptible tool, so a turn
//     pauses for approval before moving money and resumes with the answer.
//   - barista (barista.go): an Agent[BaristaOrder] whose system instruction is
//     a function. A tool writes the order into session state and the prompt
//     reads it back, so each turn knows what earlier ones established.
//   - orchestrator (orchestrator.go): delegates to sub-agents through
//     per-agent tools, merging their artifacts into its own session.
//   - commander (commander.go): the same middleware with Async set, so an
//     incident commander starts its investigators in the background, keeps
//     posting status updates while they work, and collects the results after.
//
// cli.go holds the CLI: it lists the agents, streams each turn, renders tool
// calls as they happen, and routes interrupts. Conversation state persists to a
// per-agent FileSessionStore under ./.genkit/snapshots/<agent>/, except for the
// orchestrator's sub-agents, which run statelessly per delegation. The
// commander's investigators do keep stores, which is what lets them run in the
// background.
//
// Run it:
//
//	go run .
//
// Or with the Dev UI, which keeps the CLI on the terminal and adds a trace of
// every turn at http://localhost:4000/traces:
//
//	curl -sL cli.genkit.dev | bash    # install the Genkit CLI, once
//	genkit start -- go run .
//
// Pick an agent, resume from its last snapshot or start fresh, then chat.
// Inside a chat:
//
//	(text)             send a message and stream the reply
//	/detach (text...)  send the text, then leave it running in the background
//	                   and return to the agent list. Re-pick the agent to wait
//	                   for the snapshot, or to stop it and resume from the
//	                   turns it finished.
//	/back              return to the agent list
//	/quit              exit
//
// Four worth trying: "/detach write me a long pirate story", then re-pick
// pirate to wait on it; banker with "send $200 to alice" (over the $150
// balance) or "send $120 to bob" (large enough to need approval); barista,
// where ordering a drink and later asking "what have I ordered?" is answered
// from session state rather than from the transcript; and commander with
// "checkout-api is throwing 500s and customers can't pay", which posts its
// first status update while its investigators are still running.
