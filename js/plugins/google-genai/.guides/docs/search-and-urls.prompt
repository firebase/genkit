title: Search Grounding and URL Context
description: read this to understand how to ground results on Google search or automatically ingest URLs in prompts to understand their contents

When using Gemini models, you can add configuration to automatically ground the prompt in Google search:

```ts
const {text} = await ai.generate({
  model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  // this includes the "built-in" search grounding tool
  config: {
    tools: [
      {googleSearch: {}},
    ]
  }
})
```

If your prompt contains URLs that you want the model to read and understand, you can add the URL context tool:

```ts
const {text} = await ai.generate({
  model: googleAI.model('gemini-2.5-flash'),
  // this includes the "built-in" url fetching tool
  config: {
    tools: [
      {urlContext: {}},
    ]
  }
})
```

You can use either or both of these tools to improve the "groundedness" of your generated model responses.
