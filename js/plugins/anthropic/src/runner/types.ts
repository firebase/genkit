 * Type contract that each Anthropic runner passes into the generic `BaseRunner`.
 *
 * The concrete runners (stable vs. beta SDKs) bind these slots to their SDK’s
 * concrete interfaces so the shared logic in `BaseRunner` can stay strongly typed
 * without knowing which SDK variant it is talking to.
 *
 * Properties are `unknown` by default, so every subclass must plug in the
 * correct Anthropic types to keep the generic plumbing sound.
