## Contribution process

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Setup

**Note:** If you want to setup all runtime environments at the same time
(js/go/py), you may want to run the `bin/setup` script. Beware, this script may
break other setup you may already have in your project environment.

Genkit supports JavaScript, Go, and Python. Before contributing in any of these languages, complete these prerequisites:

1. Install Node.js 20 or later using [nvm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

   > **Note:** Node.js v20 or greater is required. Earlier versions may not work properly.

2. Install the Genkit CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g genkit-cli
   ```

After completing these prerequisites, follow the language-specific setup instructions below.

## Go Guide

1. Install Go 1.24 or later
   Follow the [official Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. Configure your AI model
   Most samples use Google's Gemini model. You'll need to generate an API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

   Once you have your key, set it in your environment:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```

3. Run a sample application

   ```bash
   cd go/samples          # Navigate to samples directory
   cd <sample-name>       # Choose a sample to run
   go mod tidy            # Install Go dependencies
   genkit start -- go run .  # Start the Genkit server and run the application
   ```

   Once running, visit http://localhost:4000 to access the Developer UI.

4. Run tests
   ```bash
   cd <test-directory>    # Navigate to test directory
   go test .              # Run tests in current directory
   ```

## JS Guide

### Install dependencies

Run `corepack enable pnpm` to enable pnpm.

```
pnpm i
pnpm run setup
```

This will install all dependencies and build all packages.

### Build it

```
pnpm build
```

This will build all packages in this repository. This is recommended the first time you check out a fresh repo or pull new revisions.

### Pack it

Pack packages for testing/distribution.

Assuming you built everything previously, navigate to the `genkit-tools` directory and run:

```bash
cd genkit-tools
pnpm pack:all
```

This command will:
1.  Produce tarball packages (`.tgz` files) for `cli`, `telemetry-server`, and `common` in the `genkit-tools/dist` folder.
2.  Produce a `genkit-dist.zip` file (a zip of all the package tarballs) in the `genkit-tools/dist` folder.
3.  Additionally, it will use Bun (which must be installed) to create stand-alone executable binaries for the Genkit CLI in the `genkit-tools/dist` folder. Targets include:
    *   macOS (Apple Silicon): `genkit-bun-macos-arm64`
    *   macOS (Intel): `genkit-bun-macos-x64`
    *   Linux (x64): `genkit-bun-linux-x64`
    *   Windows (x64): `genkit-bun-windows-x64.exe`
    These binaries allow users to run the Genkit CLI without needing a Node.js or Bun installation.

### Link it

You will need the Genkit CLI to run test apps and the Developer UI (this is done for you with `pnpm run setup`):

```
pnpm link-genkit-cli
```

## Run it

### Run a flow

In the `js/testapps` folder you will find some test apps using Genkit. They might contain instructions for how to run them and what setup is necessary.

Here's one that requires no setup:

```
cd js/testapps/flow-sample1
genkit start -- tsx --watch src/index.ts
```

Point your browser to http://localhost:4000

### Run an evaluation

We'll be using the `pdfQA` flow for our example.

To start, let's make sure we have some context to pull from the vector store.

1. Start the Developer UI

```
cd js/testapps/evals
genkit start -- pnpm genkit:dev
```

2. Click on the `indexPdf` flow in the left nav.
3. Input paths to pdfs you want to index. There's one checked into the directory:

```
"./docs/cat-handbook.pdf"
```

4. Run an evaluation on a sample dataset checked into the testapp

```
genkit eval:flow pdfQA --input ./data/cat_adoption_questions.json
```

5. Go to the **Evaluations** tab in the Developer UI to view the evaluation results.

## Code it

FYI: `js` and `genkit-tools` are in two separate workspaces.

As you make changes you may want to build and test things by running test apps.
You can reduce the scope of what you're building by running a specific build command:

```
pnpm build:genkit
pnpm build:genkit-tools
```

But you can also go into specific package that you changed and run

```
pnpm build
```

If you are going to be coding for a while then do

```
pnpm build:watch
```

in the package that you're editing.

## Document it

If you are contributing to the core Genkit JS SDK (under the `/js` directory), please make sure that all exported members have a valid [JSDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) associated with them.

Use the following command to build and view the new API reference locally.

```
cd js && pnpm build && pnpm typedoc-html && open api-refs-js/index.html
```

## Send it

Once done coding you will want to send a PR. Always do things in a separate branch (by convention name the branch `your-name/feature-something`).

Before sending the PR, always run:

```
pnpm format
pnpm build
```
